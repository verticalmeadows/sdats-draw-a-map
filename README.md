# sdats-draw-a-map
Online map drawing interface used for the perceptual dialectology task in the SDATS survey (Swiss German Dialects Across Time and Space)

# Functionalities

This custom made drawing tool is based on Leaflet FreeDraw https://github.com/Wildhoney/Leaflet.FreeDraw (https://freedraw.herokuapp.com/ ), written in Javascript. We invite you to test the SDATS interface (https://map.dialektatlas.ch) using codes ranging from 'SC10' to 'SC99'.

The participant logs in using a 4-digit UID assigned to them. They see a digital map prepared specifically for the SDATS data collection. Zooming is not possible and panning the map is only possible using the keyboard arrows.

The participant draws shapes on the map by mouse (or touchpad), clicking and dragging lines. When the mouse button is released, the shape drawn closes automatically, drawing a straight line between the mouse pointer and the starting point of the shape. Overlapping shapes are possible, but starting to draw a shape in another polygon is not. Every new shape is automatically saved into a geojson file on a server - one file corresponds to one participant. Deleting shapes is possible by clicking in their middle. Adjusting a shape is possible by moving the vertices and adding new vertices (elbows) in between existing ones.

Importantly, the shapes are automatically simplified after they are finished, which makes them less complex than originally drawn by the speaker. It is possible to change the smoothing factor: https://github.com/Wildhoney/Leaflet.FreeDraw#setting-modes
